    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1
            tablespoon oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour until
            dough is smooth and workable.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1
            teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise
            until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves
            in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill.
        </li>
    </ol>
